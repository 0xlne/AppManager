## Options Menu
Options menu has several options which can be used to sort, filter the listed apps as well as navigate to different pages.

### Sort
Apps listed on the main page can be sorted in different ways. The sorting preference is preserved which means the apps will be sorted the same way that was sorted in the previous launch. Regardless of your sorting preference, however, the apps are first sorted alphabetically to prevent random results.
- _User app first_ - User apps will appear first
- _App label_ - Sort in ascending order based on the app labels (also known as app name). This is the default sorting preference
- _Package name_ - Sort in ascending order based on package names
- _Last update_ - Sort in descending order based on the package update date (or install date if it is a newly installed package)
- _Shared user ID_ - Sort in descending order based on kernel user id
- _Target SDK_ - Sort in ascending order based on the target SDK
- _Signature_ - Sort in ascending order based on app's signing info
- _Disabled first_ - List disabled apps first
- _Blocked first_ - Sort in descending order based on the number of blocked components

### Filter
Apps listed on the main page can be filtered in a number of ways. Like sorting, filtering preferences are stored as well and retained after a relaunch.
- _User apps_ - List only user apps
- _System apps_ - List only system apps
- _Disabled apps_ - List only disabled apps
- _Apps with rules_ - List only apps with blocking rules

Unlike sorting, you can filter using more than one option. For example, you can list all disabled user apps by filtering app lists using _User apps_ and _Disabled apps_. This is also useful for batch operations where you can filter all users apps to carry out certain operation.

### 1-Click Ops
**1-Click Ops** stands for **One-Click Operations**. You can directly open the corresponding page by clicking on this option.
