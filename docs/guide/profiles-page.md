## Options Menu
There are two options menu in this page. The three dots menu at the top-right offers two options such as _presets_ and _import_.
- **Presets.** Presets option lists a number of built-in profiles that can be used as a starting point. The profiles are generated from the project [Universal Android Debloater][uad].

- **Import.** This option can be used to import an existing profile.

Another options menu appears when you long click on any profile. They have options such as
- **Apply nowâ€¦.** This option can be used to apply the profile directly. When clicked, a dialog will be displayed where you can select a [profile state][profile_state]. On selecting one of the options, the profile will be applied immediately.
- **Delete.** Clicking on delete will remove the profile immediately without any warning.
- **Duplicate.** This option can be used to duplicate the profile. When clicked, an input box will be displayed where you can set the profile name. If you click "OK", a new profile will be created and the [profile page][profile] will be loaded. The profile will not be saved until you save it manually.
- **Export.** Export the profile to an external storage. Profile exported this way can be imported using the _import_ option in the three dots menu.
- **Create shortcut.** This option can be used to create a shortcut for the profile. When clicked, there will be two options: _Simple_ and _Advanced_. The latter option allows you to set the [profile state][profile_state] before applying it while the former option use the default state that was configured when the profile was last saved.
