"App Manager is an advanced package manager for Android. It offers many "

"Manager in the sense that it contains the description of every feature that "
"App Manager has to offer. The document can be considered as the ``official'' "
"guidelines for App Manager and represent the expected behaviour of App "
"Manager. Translations can misinterpret this document (which is written in "
"English). Therefore, it is recommended that you read the English version if "
"possible. There might be other unofficial or third-party resources such as "
"blog articles, videos, chat groups, etc.  While these resources might be "

"App Manager - это продвинутый менеджер пакетов для Android. Он предлагает "

"содержит описание каждой функции, которую может предложить App Manager. Этот "

"\\textbf{App Ops} (short hand for \\textbf{Application Operations}) are used "

"permissions. The user \\emph{can} control some permissions, but only the "
"permissions that are considered dangerous (and Google thinks knowing your "

"need if we want to install apps like Facebook and it's Messenger (the latter "
"literary records everything if you live outside the EU) and still want "
"\\emph{some} privacy and/or security. Although certain features of app ops "
"were available in Settings and later in hidden settings in older version of "
"Android, it's completely hidden in newer versions of Android and is "
"continued to be kept hidden. Now, any app with "
"\\textbf{android.Manifest.permission.GET\\_APP\\_OPS\\_STATS} permission can "
"get the app ops information for other applications but this permission is "
"hidden from users and can only be enabled using ADB or root. Still, the app "
"with this permission cannot grant or revoke permissions (actually mode of "
"operation) for apps other than itself (with limited capacity, of course). To "
"modify the ops of other app, the app needs "
"\\textbf{android.Manifest.permission.UPDATE\\_APP\\_OPS\\_STATS} permissions "
"which isn't accessible via \\texttt{pm} command.  So, you cannot grant it "
"via root or ADB, the permission is only granted to the system apps. There "
"are very few apps who support disabling permissions via app ops. The best "
"one to my knowledge is "
"\\href{https://github.com/8enet/AppOpsX}{AppOpsX}. The main (visible) "
"difference between my app (AppManager) and this app is that the latter also "
"provides you the ability to revoke internet permissions (by writing ip "
"tables). One crucial problem that I faced during the development of the app "
"ops API is the lack of documentation in English language."
