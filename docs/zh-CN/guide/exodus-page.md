# εxodus 页
εxodus page appears after clicking on the _εxodus_ button in the [App Info tab][1] in the [App Details][2] page. It scans for trackers and displays a list of trackers and their classes as a summary. A list of tracker classes for the given app is also displayed. All the classes of the app can also be viewed by clicking on the _Toggle Class Listing_ menu. A sneak-peek of each class can be viewed by simply clicking on any class item. The tracker names have some prefixes, and although they are not properly documented in the [original repository][3], a list is given below:
- `°` - Missing in εxodus' list
- `²` - [ETIP][4] stand-by
- `µ` - Micro non-intrusive
- `?` - Unconfirmed
