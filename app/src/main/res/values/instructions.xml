    <string name="adb_over_tcp" translatable="false">ADB over TCP</string>
    <string name="adb_over_tcp_description" translatable="false">Many root-only features can still be used by enabling
        ADB over TCP. To do that, a PC or Mac is required with ADB tools installed, and an Android
        phone with Developer Mode &amp; USB debugging enabled
        (<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/">tutorial</a>).

        \n\nAfter fulfilling the above requirement, the phone has to be connected to the PC or Mac
        using a data cable. Then, in a command prompt, power shell or terminal, the following
        command has to be run:

        \n\n<i>adb tcpip 5555</i>

        \n\nAfter that, App Manager has to be relaunched. In some Android phones, an alert prompt will
        be appeared with a message <i>Allow USB Debugging</i> in which case, check <i>Always allow
        from this computer</i> and click <i>Allow</i>. In some other Android phones, the data cable
        may need to be connected or disconnected in order for it to work.

    <string name="main_window" translatable="false">Main Window</string>
    <string name="main_window_description" translatable="false">Main window lists all the installed apps (or a list of
        apps supplied by any third-party application). A single click on any app item opens the
        respective <b>App Details</b> window. Using the <i>sort</i> option from the menu, the app
        items can be sorted in various ways and preserved on close. It also possible to filter items
        based on your needs using the <i>Filter</i> option in the menu. You can filter using more
        than one options.

        \n\nBatch operations or operation on multiple apps are also available within this window
        (most these operations require root or ADB). To enable multiple selection mode, click on any
        app icon or long click on any app. After that you can use the regular click to select apps
        instead of opening the <b>App Details</b> window. These operations include:
        \n\u2022 Backup apk file (no root)
        \n\u2022 Backup/restore/delete app data (apk, dex, app data, etc.)
        \n\u2022 Clear data from apps
        \n\u2022 Disable/uninstall/kill apps
        \n\u2022 Disable run in background, ads and trackers

        \n\n1-click operations can be accessed by clicking on the <b>1-Click Ops</b> option in the
        menu. See the corresponding section below to learn about the features implemented there.

        \n\nApp usage statistics such as screen time, data usage (mobile and Wifi), number of times an
        app was opened can be accessed by clicking on the <b>App Usage</b> option in the menu
        (requires <i>Usage Access</i> permission). A list of running apps or processes can also be

        session using the <i>Termux</i> option in the menu.
    </string>
    <string name="app_details_window" translatable="false">App Details Window</string>
    <string name="app_details_window_description" translatable="false">App Info tab contains general information about the
        app such as app directories, data directories, sdk version, install date, last update date,
        installer app, data usage, app size, data size, cache size (some of these information
        require <i>Usage Access</i> permission). It also has the ability to perform many actions,
        some of which are listed below:
        \n\u2022 Launch/install/uninstall/update/enable/disable/force-stop (some operations require root or ADB)
        \n\u2022 View dynamic manifest
        \n\u2022 View shared preferences: clicking on a preference opens the <b>Shared Preferences
            Editor</b> window (requires root)
        \n\u2022 View split apk (bundled app) info
        \n\u2022 View number of tracking components
        \n\u2022 Scan for trackers using \u03b5xodus
        \n\u2022 Open paths and directories with external app
        \n\u2022 Delete app cache or app data (requires root or ADB)
        \n\u2022 Export blocking rules
        \n\u2022 Open in system settings (in the menu)
        \n\u2022 Open in F-Droid, Aurora Droid or Aurora Store (if installed)
        \n\u2022 Share/save the apk file as apk, or apks if the app is a bundled app (in the menu)

        \n\nOther tabs list application components such as activities, broadcast receivers, services,
        providers as well as app operations (ie. app ops), permissions, features, configurations,
        shared libraries and signatures. Most of these information actually come from the
        application manifest. The manifest has two kinds of permissions: <i>permission</i> and
        <i>uses-permission</i>, which is why there are two tabs for permissions in the window
        (named accordingly).

        \n\nWith root or ADB, any app op or any <i>dangerous</i> permission can be granted or
        revoked. With root, any app component (that is activities, broadcast receivers, services
        and providers) can also be blocked via intent firewall (for activities, receivers and
        services) or (for providers,) using the <i>pm</i> command line tool. There is a toggle
        button on the right side of each component item which can be used to block or unblock each
        component, and there is a switch button next to each app op or permission item. By default,
        when components are blocked using the block buttons, they are not immediately applied. To
        apply them, <i>Apply Rules</i> option in the menu has to be used. Another option is to
        enable component blocking globally in the app settings. There is also an option to disable
        all tracker components in the menu as well as sorting by blocking components. In this latter
        case and for app ops and permissions, the changes are applied immediately. Activities that
        are marked as <i>exported</i> in the app manifest can be launched, or customizable launcher
        icons or shortcuts can be created in the <b>Activities</b> tab. For app ops, there is an
        option to disable all dangerous app ops or reset them. For permissions, there is an option
        to revoke all dangerous permissions as well. Like components, both app ops and permissions
        can be sorted in different ways.

        \n\nList of background colors used in the tabs and their meaning:
        \n\u2022 <font bgcolor="#B3FF0000" fgcolor="#DE000000"> Red (day) </font> or <font
            bgcolor="#FF790D0D" fgcolor="#FFAAAAAA"> dark red (night) </font>: Any app op or
            permission that has the dangerous flag is marked as red. Components that are blocked
            within App Manager are also marked as red
        \n\u2022 <font bgcolor="#FFFF8A80" fgcolor="#DE000000"> Light red (day) </font> or <font
            bgcolor="#BF4F1C14" fgcolor="#FFAAAAAA"> very dark red (night) </font>: Components that
            are disabled outside App Manager have these colors. It should be noted that a component
            that is marked as disabled does not always mean that it is disabled by the user: It
            could be disabled by the system as well or marked as disabled in the app manifest. Also,
            all components of a disabled app are also considered disabled by the system (and by the
            App Manager as well)
        \n\u2022 <font bgcolor="#FFFF8017" fgcolor="#DE000000"> Vivid orange (day) </font> or <font
            bgcolor="#80FF8017" fgcolor="#FFAAAAAA"> very dark orange (night) </font>: Tracker or
            add components
        \n\u2022 <font bgcolor="#FFEA80FC" fgcolor="#DE000000"> Soft magenta (day) </font> or <font
            bgcolor="#FF431C5D" fgcolor="#FFAAAAAA"> very dark violet (night) </font>: Currently
            running services

        \n\nIf an external apk file is opened using App Manager, you will be offered to install or
        update the app within App Manager. For updates, the <b>What\'s New</b> button can be used to
        see changes in application components, trackers, permissions, etc.

    <string name="one_click_ops_window" translatable="false">1-Click Ops Window</string>
    <string name="one_click_ops_window_description" translatable="false">This window appears after clicking on the
        <b>1-Click Ops</b> option in the main menu. Currently supported operations include:
        \n\u2022 <b>Block Trackers</b>: This option can be used to block ad/tracker components from
        all the installed apps. When clicking on this option, you will be offered to select whether
        to list all apps or only the user apps. For novice users, it is recommended to select user
        apps only. After that, a multichoice dialog box will appear where you can deselect the apps
        you want to exclude from this operation. Clicking on <i>apply</i> will apply the changes
        immediately. Certain apps may not function as expected after applying the blocking. If that
        is the case, remove blocking rules all at once or one by one using the corresponding <b>App
        Details</b> window.
        \n\u2022 <b>Block Componentsâ¦</b>: This option can be used to block certain app components
        denoted by the signatures. App signature is the full name or partial name of the components.
        For safety, it is recommended that you should add a . (dot) at the end of each partial
        signature name as the algorithm used here chooses all matched components in a greedy manner.
        You can insert more than one signature in which case all signatures have to be separated by
        spaces. Similar to the option above, there is an option to apply blocking to system apps as
        well. If you are not aware of the consequences of applying signature blocking, you should
        not use this setting as it may result in boot loop or soft brick and you may have to apply
        factory reset in order to use your OS.
        \n\u2022 <b>Deny App Opsâ¦</b>: This option can be used to block certain app operations for
        all or selected apps. You can insert more than one app op constants separated by spaces. It
        is not possible in advance to know all app op constants as they vary from device to device
        and OS to OS. To find the desired app op constant, browse the <b>App Ops</b> tab in the
        <b>App Details</b> window. The constants are integers closed inside brackets next to each
        app op name. Unless you are well informed about app ops and the consequences of blocking
        them, you should not use this feature as it may result in boot loop or soft brick and you
        may have to apply factory reset in order to use your OS.

        \n\u2022 <b>Global component blocking</b>: Enable component blocking globally. By default,
        blocking rules are not applied unless they are applied in the <i>App Details</i> window for
        any package. Upon enabling this option, all (old and new) rules are applied immediately for
        all apps without explicitly enabling blocking for any app
        \n\u2022 <b>Usage access</b>: Turning off this option disables the <i>App Usage</i> window
        as well as data usage and app storage info in the <i>App Info</i> window. With this option
        turned off, App Manager will never ask for <i>Usage Access</i> permission
        \n\u2022 <b>Import/export blocking rules</b>: It is possible to import or export blocking
        rules within App Manager for all apps. There is a choice to export or import only certain
        rules (components, app ops or permissions) instead of all of them. It is also possible to
        import blocking rules from Blocker and Watt. If it is necessary to export blocking rules for
