<h6>Notes</h6>
<p>
    In order to use wireless debugging, first enable ADB over TCP as usual and select <b>Always allow from this
    computer</b>.
    When App Manager is working on this mode, enable wireless debugging, and then, go to App Manager settings and
    change <b>Mode of Operations</b> to <i>Wireless Debugging</i>. At this point, App Manager should display a prompt
    where the port number from the wireless debugging window should be inserted. With this mode enabled,
    App Manager will display this prompt everytime it requires the port number. As always, remember to disable wireless
    debugging once App Manager's initialization screen goes away. Unless you're using MIUI, you won't need to enable
    wireless debugging until the next restart.
</p>
<p>
    Aurora Store 4.0.5 have introduced promotional apps. As a result, we stopped supporting these versions.
    You can still use the previous versions without issues.
